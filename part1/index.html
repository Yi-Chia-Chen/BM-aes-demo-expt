        <div class='pageBox' id='consentBox'>
            <div class='consentInstr'>To conduct this experiment, we need to include this information sheet:</div>
            <div id='consentTextBox'>
                <strong>INFORMATION SHEET</strong><br />
                A computational investigation into biological motion perception<br /><br />
                You are invited to participate in a research study on human vision, conducted by Hongjing Lu, PhD, of the Dept. of Psychology at UCLA. You were selected as a possible participant in this study because you have normal or corrected vision, and are 18 years of age or older.<br /><br />
                <strong>Purpose of Study</strong><br />
                The purpose of the study is to understand how we use visual information to detect and recognize human action.<br /><br />
                <strong>Procedures Involved in Study</strong> <br />
                If you agree to participate, you will receive a demographic questionnaire to collect information of your age, gender, ethnicity, and language. Then, you will be presented with visual stimuli involving human actions (e.g., walking, running) on a computer screen. Your task is to detect the action, or to identify the action. You will be asked to press one of two computer buttons to make responses. You will also be asked to fill out a 50-item questionnaire. Each question is a statement describing yourself and here is one example of questions you will be asked to answer: "I prefer to do things with others rather than on my own."" You need to choose from one of the following four choices: "definitely agree", "slightly agree", "slightly disagree" and "definitely disagree". Your answers will be recorded by the computer. Your answers will not be identified with you in any way. The session will take about 15-20 minutes. <br /><br />
                <strong>Potential Risks and Discomforts</strong><br />
                There is no known risk/discomfort in this study. If you experience any discomfort during the course of the experiment, you can stop at any time and notify the experimenter.<br /><br />
                <strong>Potential Benefits to Subject</strong><br />
                There are no direct benefits from participating in this study.<br /><br />
                <strong>Potential Benefits to Society</strong><br />
                The findings of the study will help the design of artificial visual systems for detecting and recognizing human action in a natural environment.<br /><br />
                <strong>Payment for Participation</strong><br />
                You will receive 1hr of credit for your psychology class if you signed up for the study through the UCLA Psychology Department Subject Pool; otherwise you will receive the payment in the rate of $8 per hour for your participation.<br /><br />
                <strong>Alternatives to Participation</strong><br />
                An alternative to participating in this project and fulfilling Psychology 10 requirements is to participate in other research or to do an equivalent classroom project. <br /><br />
                <strong>Confidentiality</strong><br />
                Your identity in this study will be treated as confidential. The results of the study, including laboratory or any other data, may be published for scientific purposes but will not give your name or include any identifiable references to you.<br /><br />
                <strong>Participation and Withdraw</strong><br />
                Your participation is VOLUNTARY.  You may withdraw from the experiment at any time without suffering any negative consequences. You may refuse to answer any questions that you do not want to answer and still remain in the study.<br /><br />
                <strong>Identification of Investigators</strong><br />
                If you have any questions, feel free to contact Dr. Hongjing Lu (hongjing@ucla.edu), at the Department of Psychology, UCLA, 405 Hilgard Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90095-1563.<br /><br />
                <strong>Rights of Research Subjects</strong><br />
                You may withdraw your consent at any time and discontinue participation without penalty.  You are not waiving any legal claims, rights or remedies because of your participation in this research study. If you wish to ask questions about your rights as a research participant or if you wish to voice any problems or concerns you may have about the study to someone other than the researchers, you may contact the UCLA Office of the Human Research Protection Program (OHRPP) by phone: (310) 206-2040; by email: participants@research.ucla.edu or by mail: Box 951406, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1406.<br /><br />
